# English → Cuneiform Translator

A generative, interactive translator that converts English text into
Cuneiform-inspired glyphs.

---

## How it works

- English letters are mapped to symbolic Cuneiform Unicode glyphs.
- Unknown letters use the divine determinative "𒀭".
- Translated text is displayed **and rains down the screen** like ancient glyphs.

---

## Features

- **Falling Glyphs:** Random and translated glyphs flow continuously in matrix-style.
- **Interactive Pulsation:** Glyphs **glow and pulsate dynamically** based on typing and translation activity.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile; the matrix adapts to screen size.
- **Living Artifact:** Each input changes the visual rhythm, making the digital temple feel alive.

## Usage

2. Click **Translate**.
